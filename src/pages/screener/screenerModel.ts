/**
 * Screener derivation layer.
 *
 * This module owns no data. It is a deterministic projection of the scanner
 * output the app already fetches (`CandidateScore`) joined to the market
 * snapshot it already fetches (`SymbolTicker`).
 *
 * Two rules govern everything below.
 *
 * 1. The score is not recomputed. `CandidateScore.score` is produced server-side
 *    from candles, order books and funding history that the browser never sees in
 *    full. Summing the five published sub-scores here would replace an
 *    authoritative number with a strictly worse client-side approximation that
 *    silently disagrees with every other surface in the app. The screener ranks
 *    with the published score as the base of `signalStrengthOf` — never in place
 *    of it — and uses the sub-scores only to explain the result.
 *
 * 2. Absent inputs stay absent. Every value that can fail to arrive is wrapped in
 *    `ScreenerMetric` with an explicit note, so an unavailable reading can never
 *    be mistaken for a real one. Nothing is defaulted to zero or to a neutral
 *    midpoint.
 *
 * No React, no DOM, no clock, no randomness: the same inputs always produce
 * byte-identical output, which is what makes the whole page testable.

 * diverge constantly in live data: the scan that prompted this change opened with
 * a 90 that had failed its risk guard and carried five objections, ranked above
 * clean rows in the low 80s. Strength is the composite that decides `rank`. It is
 * NOT a second score: `score` is untouched, authoritative, and still the number
 * the UI prints.
 *
 * Four terms, in the order they dominate:
 *
 * 1. `score` — the scanner's published 0-100, the base. Never recomputed.
 * 2. Risk guard: −12 when it fails. The guard is an explicit objection to trading
 *    the symbol at all, so it outweighs any plausible score gap between two
 *    otherwise comparable rows.
 * 3. Readiness tier: CONFIRMED +6, WATCHLIST +3, CAUTION 0, BLOCKED −6. The
 *    scanner's own verdict, weighted as a nudge so a strong CAUTION can still beat
 *    a weak WATCHLIST rather than being partitioned below it.
 * 4. Conviction: −1.5 per warning, capped at −9 so one noisy row cannot fall off
 *    the end of the list, plus up to −6 for missing evidence coverage (−1.5 when
 *    coverage was not reported at all). At equal score the cleaner, better-evidenced
 *    row ranks higher — which is the whole point.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a term: LONG vs SHORT. The scanner publishes short theses as
 * first-class setups, so ranking one bias above the other would be a directional
 * opinion the data does not support. "Opportunity over Risk over Avoid" is
 * `readinessTier`, which term 3 already carries.
